//  7-ex8_weekPayment2.c - calculate the payment in a week.
//  - Solution to Programming Exercise 8, Chapter 7, C Primer Plus, 6th. Page 297
//
//  - Modify assumption a. in exercise 7 so that the program presents a menu of pay rates 
//	  from which to choose. Use a switch to select the pay rate. The beginning of a run 
//	  should look something like this:
//	  ***************************************************************** 
//	  Enter the number corresponding to the desired pay rate or action: 
//	  1) $8.75/hr 							2) $9.33/hr
//	  3) $10.00/hr 							4) $11.20/hr
// 	  5) quit 
//	  *****************************************************************
//
//	  If choices 1 through 4 are selected, the program should request the hours worked. The 
//	  program should recycle until 5 is entered. If something other than choices 1 through 5 
//	  is entered, the program should remind the user what the proper choices are and then 
//	  recycle. Use #defined constants for the various earning rates and tax rates.
