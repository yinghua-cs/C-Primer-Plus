//  - The ABC Mail Order Grocery sells artichokes for $2.05 per pound, beets for $1.15 per 
// 	  pound, and carrots for $1.09 per pound. It gives a 5% discount for orders of $100 or 
// 	  more prior to adding shipping costs. It charges $6.50 shipping and handling for any 
// 	  order of 5 pounds or under, $14.00 shipping and handling for orders over 5 pounds
// 	  and under 20 pounds, and $14.00 plus $0.50 per pound for shipments of 20 pounds or 
// 	  more. Write a program that uses a switch statement in a loop such that a response of a 
// 	  lets the user enter the pounds of artichokes desired, b the pounds of beets, c the pounds 
// 	  of carrots, and q allows the user to exit the ordering process. The program should keep 
// 	  track of cumulative totals. That is, if the user enters 4 pounds of beets and later enters
// 	  5 pounds of beets, the program should use report 9 pounds of beets. The program then
// 	  should compute the total charges, the discount, if any, the shipping charges, and the 
// 	  grand total. The program then should display all the purchase information: the cost per 
// 	  pound, the pounds ordered, and the cost for that order for each vegetable, the total cost 
// 	  of the order, the discount (if there is one), the shipping charge, and the grand total of all 
// 	  the charges.
